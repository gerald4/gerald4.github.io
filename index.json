Many XAI approaches have emerged in recent years. Consequently, a subfield related to the evaluation of XAI methods has gained considerable attention, with the aim to determine which methods provide the best explanation using various approaches and criteria. However, the literature lacks a comparison of the evaluation metrics themselves, that one can use to evaluate XAI methods. This work aims to fill this gap by comparing 14 different metrics when applied to 8 state-of-the-art XAI methods and 3 dummy methods (e.g., random saliency maps) used as reference bases. We show which of these metrics produce concordant results and which ones differ, indicating redundancy. We also demonstrate the important impact of specific hyperparameters on the evaluation metric values. Finally, we use the dummy (i.e. naive) methods to assess the reliability of metrics in terms of ranking. We uncover four redundant metrics and show that varying a specific hyperparameter strongly hinders evaluation metrics‚Äô coherence. The main takeaway of our work is to highlight the importance of using metrics carefully, while being aware of their potential limitations when evaluating explainability methods.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An Experimental Investigation into the Evaluation of Explainability Methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description in progress\u0026hellip;\n","date":1638057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638057600,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"https://gerald4.github.io/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"In progress","tags":null,"title":"EOS VeriLearn Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["G√©raldin Nanfack","Paul Temple","Beno√Æt Fr√©nay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618012800,"objectID":"c613964539060f72b7b5ca0b841b7b61","permalink":"https://gerald4.github.io/publication/survey/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/survey/","section":"publication","summary":"Decision trees have the particularity of being machine learning models that are visually easy to interpret and understand. Therefore, they are primarily suited for sensitive domains like medical diagnosis, where decisions need to be explainable. However, if used on complex problems, decision trees can become large, making them hard to grasp. In addition to this aspect, when learning decision trees, it may be necessary to consider a broader class of constraints, such as the fact that two variables should not be used in a single branch of the tree. This motivates to enforce constraints in learning algorithms of decision trees. We propose a survey of works that attempted to solve the problem of learning decision trees under constraints. Our contributions are fourfold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that deals with constraints on decision trees. Second, we define a flexible taxonomy of constraints applied to decision trees and methods for their treatment in the literature. Third, we benchmark state-of-the art depth-constrained decision tree learners with respect to predictive accuracy and computational time. Fourth, we discuss potential future research directions that would be of interest for researchers who wish to conduct research in this field.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Constraint Enforcement on Decision Trees: a Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G√©raldin Nanfack","Paul Temple","Beno√Æt Fr√©nay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618012800,"objectID":"53caa4b7fec0a7d3a33914dbbbaf5829","permalink":"https://gerald4.github.io/publication/pattern_recognition/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pattern_recognition/","section":"publication","summary":"When applied to critical domains, machine learning models usually need to comply with prior knowledge and domain-specific requirements. For example, one may require that a learned decision tree model should be of limited size and fair, so as to be easily interpretable, trusted and adopted. However, most state-of-the-art models, even on decision trees, only aim to maximising expected accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework in which a diverse family of prior and domain knowledge can be formalised and imposed as constraints on decision trees. This framework is built upon a newly introduced tree representation that leads to two generic linear programming formulations of the optimal decision tree problem. The first one targets binary features, while the second one handles continuous features without the need for discretisation. We theoretically show how a diverse family of constraints can be formalised in our framework. We validate the framework with constraints on several applications and perform extensive experiments, demonstrating empirical evidence of comparable performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art tree learners.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Learning Customised Decision Trees for Domain-knowledge Constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G√©raldin Nanfack","Valentin Delchevalerie","Beno√Æt Fr√©nay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610236800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610236800,"objectID":"1d8ababbed95ac630d38b65f9dda22e9","permalink":"https://gerald4.github.io/publication/esann_paper/","publishdate":"2021-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/esann_paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) are popular models in Machine Learning (ML) thanks to their interpretability and efficiency to solve real-world problems.

Yet, in critical applications such as in healthcare or justice, if models cannot be explained, domain experts will be reluctant to use them.  A common way to explain a black-box model is to approximate it by a simpler model such as a decision tree. In this paper, we propose a co-learning framework to learn decision rules as explanations of black-box models through knowledge distillation and simultaneously constrain the black-box model by these explanations; all of this in a differentiable manner. To do so, we introduce the soft truncated Gaussian mixture analysis (STruGMA), a probabilistic model which encapsulates hyper-rectangle decision rules. With STruGMA, global explanations can be extracted by any rule learner such as decision lists, sets or trees. We provide evidences through experiments that our framework can globally explain differentiable black-box models such as neural networks. In particular, the explanation fidelity is increased, while the accuracy of the models is marginally impacted.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Global Explanations with Decision Rules: a Co-learning Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G√©raldin Nanfack","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, if they were limited to classification tasks, nowadays with contributions from Scientific Communities who are embarking in this field, they have become very useful in higher level tasks such as object detection and pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Thus, brilliant ideas in the field of semantic segmentation with deep learning have completed the state of the art of accuracy, however this architectures become very difficult to apply in embedded systems as is the case for autonomous driving. We present a new Deep fully Convolutional Neural Network for pixel-wise semantic segmentation which we call Squeeze-SegNet. The architecture is based on Encoder-Decoder style. We use a SqueezeNet-like encoder and a decoder formed by our proposed squeeze-decoder module and upsample layer using downsample indices like in SegNet and we add a deconvolution layer to provide final multi-channel feature map. On datasets like Camvid or City-states, our net gets SegNet-level accuracy with less than 10 times fewer parameters than SegNet.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Squeeze-SegNet: a new fast deep convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
